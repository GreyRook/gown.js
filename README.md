===========

UI system for [pixi.js](http://pixijs.com) inspired by [feathers-ui](http://feathersui.com).

[![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/brean/gown.js.svg?branch=master)](http://inch-ci.org/github/brean/gown.js)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brean/gown.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brean/gown.js)


Features
========
 1. Basic UI components
     - **Button**: simple Button, with label and background, easy to extend using themes
     - **ToggleButton**: a button with on/off state
     - **Slider** a simple slider with modifyable start and end value

 1. Layouting
     - **LayoutGroup**: a component to create horizontal, vertical or tile-based layouts

 1. Scrollable container
     - **ScrollArea**: a viewport that can be scrolled using mouse (including mouse wheel) or touch gestures.  When its content is a LayoutGroup the scroll behaviour will be dependent on its layout: a horizontal layoutgroup will default to horizontal scrolling, vertical layout to vertical scrolling.  But you are in control and can manually overwrite the scroll behaviour.
     - **ScrollBar**: providing a scroll thumb that can be moved. gets automatically oriented on the given ScrollArea

 1. A Text input providing text and password input (based on [PIXI Input](https://github.com/SebastianNette/PIXI.Input) )

 1. Basic shapes that provide width and height that can be changed easily (for use in themes for example)


Folder structure
================

 - examples - simple examples to show the usage (and to have something more graphical besides the jasmine-tests)

 - lib - required libraries (just pixi-dev)

 - src - source code for gown.js

 - test - unit tests, run coverage_karma_istanbul.sh to get a table providing all files and their coverage, run coverage_blanket to start a web server that shows you the coverage for all lines of the generated browserify output file.

 - themes - basic UI example themes

  - **AeonTheme**.js A theme based on Feather's [AeonDesktopTheme](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers/tree/master/themes/AeonDesktopTheme) making use of 9-tiled images
  - **MetalWorksMobileTheme**.js a theme based on Feather's [MetalWorksMobileTheme](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers/tree/master/themes/MetalWorksMobileTheme)
  - **Themes/ShapeTheme**.js a theme using only basic shapes.


Theming
=======

 - Using the python script *themes/xml_to_json.py* you can convert your XML file from [feathers-ui](http://feathersui.com) into JSON so the default PIXI loader can parse it.

  - example:

   ```bash  
   python xml_to_json.py assets/aeon/aeon_desktop.xml
   ```

   the script requires [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (or [Pillow](http://python-pillow.github.io/)) to determine the texture width/height

 - It is possible to have different themes in one project
 - Themes can be switched at run time
 - For reference how to create your own theme check the themes folder.  It contains two different approaches on creating themes
 - The test/src/TestTheme.js is a fake theme used only for the unit tests

Under the hood
--------------
Center of the theming system is the "skins"-object. It holds unique names of different controls as key (e.g. "button" as identifier for GOWN.Button) and nested objects as value. These nested objects allow you to save different graphics for different skins (e.g. "down" when the user pressed a button down). The graphic for the state can be an images but also any kind of shape (you can set everything that can be added to a PIXI-DisplayObjectContainer as skin).
It is important that the variable width/height of your skin can be changed so your skin can be layouted correctly.
Every control need its own instance for the skin, so you have to wrap it in a function that creates a new instance of the skin.

In short, the skins-object looks like this:
`theme.skins = {<control>: {<state>: function () { new <skin>() } }}`

Rendering
=========
PIXI does the rendering. So we are independent from WebGL or the Canvas fallback.
We inherit the render functions for WebGL (_renderWebGL) and Canvas (_renderCanvas) and call a redraw-function just before the rendering.
So you can change the properties of the component. The setter/getter for this property sets an "invalid" flag of the component that will force the redraw-function to update the component just before the next draw circle (this can be the recalculation of the position and dimensions or a skin change on user interaction).

TODO
======
This list is not ordered by priority nor does it contain any promise that those items will be implemented.

 - better and more detailed documentation!

 - mouse wheel support

 - more (unit) tests/better coverage

   - test Application

   - test Scrollable, Slider and SliderData

   - test ScrollBar, ScrollThumb and ScrollArea

   - test InputControl and InputWrapper

   - more tests for Shapes

   - ignore renderAreaWebGL and renderWebGL in blanket tests

 - How-To tutorial and beginners documentation!

 - real viewport(s) for ScrollArea ?

 - build/compress themes

 - benchmarking capabilities and performance optimisation

 - handle if gown.js gets imported before pixi (?)

 - disabled-state for controls

 - more controls (and examples) for:

   - Label (not needed - just use PIXI.Text?)

   - Checkbox

   - RadioBox

   - Toggle

   - TextArea

   - DOMComponent

   - List (Item Renderer)

     - PickerList

       - Select (drop-down list for desktop)

   - Table

   - Gauge

   - charts

     - line chart

     - pie chart

     - bar chart

   - NumericStepper

   - ProgressBar

   - ScaleTool (to change width/height of a control)

   - ScrollContainer (sth. with the same API as feathers)

 - cleanup-functions to free memory/remove event listener etc. (take a look at/extend pixi destroy funtion)

 - more examples:

   - ToggleButton

   - component explorer ([like Feathers UI](http://feathersui.com/examples/components-explorer/))

   - scrolling

 - more shapes:

   - Line

   - Arc (e.g. for gauge)

   - PolyStar/Hex/Pentagon

   - Polyggon

 - Screen & Window management

   - Default Dialogs

     - confirm

     - alert/ok

     - prompt/input

 - Screen transitions

 - Animations (transition animations - see feathers -> motion -> transition ?)

 - better testing using js-imagediff and grunt ([like EaselJS does](http://blog.createjs.com/unit-tests-in-easeljs-preloadjs/))

 - Drag-and-Drop support (see [PIXI.draggalbe](https://github.com/SebastianNette/PIXI.draggable) )

 - Gestue helper (pitch-zoom)

 - evaluate cocoonjs support

 - generate UI from JSON or XML file

 - UI Designer
